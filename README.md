#The Optimal Mass Gaining Algorithm

This regimen is a 12 week mass gaining regimen designed by me that ramps up the difficulty as we go along to keep our body confused and the muscle growth coming.

We start with a 4 day split for 3 weeks to give our body ample recovery time and to let our body adjust to our nutrition.

For the next 3 weeks we then ramp up to a 5 day split, spending a full session on each muscle group.

For weeks 7-12, we'll be on a grueling 6 day split training each muscle group twice per week. We choose to give our body time to adjust to the added intensity by sticking out the last 6 weeks, hoping to achieve optimal growth and a lot of strength gain as well. Throughout those 6 weeks, our calorie count needs to increase by 500.

Enjoy the program!
